# Expectations

Elm does not follow the standard "open source" culture in certain ways, and it is important to let people know what to expect! The major surprises usually are:

- [**Work is Batched**](batching.md) - Instead of trying to respond to everything as it comes in, we try to batch the work. We find this approach produces more coherent designs, but it can be a big surprise to people coming from other projects.

- [**We Like Duplicates**](duplicates.md) - Just report the problem you are running into. Do not worry if something similar is open. More examples is better!
