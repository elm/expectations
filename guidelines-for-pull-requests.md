## Checklist

  * [x] Does your title concisely summarize your goal?
  * [x] Is your code formatted like the rest of the code?
  * [x] Does the description provide a self-contained summary of why it exists and what it does?
  * [x] Have you anticipated questions you might get?
  	  - What background material is needed to assess your PR?
  	  - Are there alternate approaches? Why are they worse?


## Guidelines

  - **Do one thing at a time.** If there are two fixes in a PR, the reviewer cannot assess them independently. That means no to one means no to both!

  - **Summarize background material.** It is great to have links to relevant discussions or information, but *only* links makes it much harder to piece together the important points. If your reviewer needs to know something, try to summarize it in a helpful way.

  - **Be friendly!** Everyone is working hard and trying to be effective.

  - **Have healthy expectations.** The workflow around Elm is optimized for throughput, not latency. This has tricky implications, so read more about it [here](expectations.md).
